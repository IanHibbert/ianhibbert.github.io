  <h1>Hi I am Ian</h1>
  <h4>Welcome to my website</h4>
  <p class="intro">
    I'm not really sure why you're here but thank you for coming. \n
    Please like and subscribe, this website survives because of the good folks on patreon.
    If you would like me and would like to keep me alive by throwing money at me, feel free to join the patreon, no pressure!
    I wrote some stuff about my life, and some of the things I learned along the way.
    Feel free to read up, it is free so yeah. Free knowledge.
    It would be pretty dumb not to read it because you're probably a d*ck up like me.
    Actually, I'm probably less d*cked up than you because I done d*cked up before.
    So read it so you can learn to stop d*cking up :)
