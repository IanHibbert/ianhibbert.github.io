You can do more than you think you're able to.
Give yourself a goal, with discipline and the belief that you can do it, you will find a way to get there.
You don't have to be the same person you were one second ago.
Find what it is you think important and allocate your fucks accordingly.
If you're unhappy, find out what is making you unhappy and change it.
Know that suffering is a part of life, there will always be problems, so figure out what you want to suffer through.
Challenge yourself, look fear in the eye and fuck it. Beauty lives on the other side of fear ~ Will Smith
You're going to go through shit anyway, might as well try to be happy about it. You'll only make it worse by choosing to feel shitty in the shit. You gotta change your perspective.
Self awareness is the key to getting what you want. Meditation and mindfulness practice will get you there.

This change happened for me what I jokingly said to myself that I'm going to do a set of 15 reps for deadlifts when the goal was 3+ AMRAP. Acheiving that allowed me to see that I am able to do more than what I normally think. Capacity is a state of mind.

I used to lie to myself saying that I didn't give a shit about what people thought, but after watching one of joe rogan's podcast it hit me. He had the same feeling but he realized that he did care about what people thought but you're insecure so you hide it and say that I don't care, people don't matter, they can't affect me. But the truth is it does, it affects the way I act, what I wear, what I think. Instead of trying to hide these feelings, I decided to embrace them. I care about what people think, so I'm going to put my best effort into making myself the person I want people to believe I am. This is a dangerous road, if your fucks are not in accordance, you can give fucks to the wrong reason as to why you care about what people think. If you place value on the words people say and think, or what you think they're thinking then you will be self-concious and start to doubt yourself. Give it your best effort and if you think those people out there are judging you, analyze what they say and be able to accept some critism. If what they're saying resonates with you then maybe you should think critcally about your life. If your happy with your choices and accept responsibility, stop giving fucks to those people and thoughts. Maybe that was a bit harsh, perhaps try to gain some perspective as to why they say what they say, maybe they're lashing out at you because of their insecurities. The point is you gotta be responsible for your own life.

You can always be kinder to someone. This gave me perspective when someone does something rude or is having a bad day. Be kinder and try do to some good. There's so much fucked up shit in the world, sadness and despair, you don't have to add to it. You can be who you want to be, there's no need to wait for the right moment because there is no such thing. There is no feeling of the right time, you have to make it the right time.

You don't have to follow the crowd. You can be the difference.
